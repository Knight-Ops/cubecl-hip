This repository contains Rust bindings for AMD ROCm HIP runtime libraries used by CubeCL.

## ⚠️ Notes
These bindings are unsafe as they are just the raw bindings generated by bindgen with no improvements.

## Prerequisites

Install ROCm in the default directory under `/opt` following the [ROCm documentation][1]:
